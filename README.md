## Description

This project is a Todo app built using React and TypeScript. The app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with functionalities such as adding, deleting, renaming, and toggling the status of todos.

The interface is styled using SCSS with the Bulma framework, and smooth transitions are implemented using `react-transition-group`.
